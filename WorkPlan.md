# Summer
### Research
After observation, I found that in normal games, colour is a very important way to assist the expression of game concepts, but after my observation and research, I found that there is no special assistive device that can help colour blind people to achieve a better gaming experience, although there is a similar product like glasses for colour blind people exists, but it doesn't provide much help for the game, so I wanted to design So I want to design a wearable product that can assist colour blind people to play games and get in a better gaming mood.
In my design, I need two parts, a personal computer and a wearable device part, the personal computer mainly displays the game scene, just like a normal screen to display normal games, the device part is mainly a controller, mainly to achieve the purpose of controlling the game, and to assist colour-blind people to distinguish colours is also done through the controller.
#### Computer
During the summer holidays I had intended to make a game using PAC-MAN, when I copied the game and processed it I found that PAC-MAN did not run as well as I had initially expected (pictures) and the game did not rely on colours as much as it should. Therefore, after discussing this with my teacher, I decided to change the game.

# Week 1
### 1. Finding the right new game-zuma 
I simply processed the colour tones in Ps and found that zuma's gameplay is very colour dependent. I simply processed the game screenshots (fig 1,2,3) and you can see that after removing all the RGB colours, zuma is very much affected by colour, which basicallymakes it a very poor gaming experience for colourblind people.

### 2.Determining the base unit sensors and testing connections

This week I have been working on the electronic connection of the sensing device for the base of the game, for the launch angle control issue
I worked on it using the MPU6050 to solve the problem of detecting the angle of rotation and connecting the button for the purpose of controlling the launcher.
